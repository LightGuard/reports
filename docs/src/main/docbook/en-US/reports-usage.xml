        Using Seam Reports is a simple four step process. These steps are the same regardless of the reporting engine
        being used.

        Of course some of these steps will have different ways of accomplishing the task, but at a high level they are
        all the same. For simplicity this quick start will use JasperReports  and the first step will be assumed to have
        already taken place and the report is available in the deployed archive. The location of the report isn't
        important, the ability to pull it into an <literal>InputStream</literal> is all that really matters.

      <!-- TODO: Add a programlisting with callouts which shows how to finish the last three steps. Data for the report
                 and the report should be done with producers in separate classes. -->
